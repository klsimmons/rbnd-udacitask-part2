# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
I used the terminal-table gem to output the list as a table.

2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) Completing Items: I added an @complete variable to items and a  "mark_complete" method that puts "Done" next to items where @complete = true.
  b) Change Priority: I added a "change_priority" method that simply changes the value of @priority.

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
I spent about a week working on this project on and off.

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Getting the table to format correctly. I had a lot of problems with older code (from before I started using the terminal-table gem) interfering with the newer code, and ferreting those out was a challenge.

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
The ability to complete items and change their priority level because they both seemed like useful base functionality for this kind of program.

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
I think I could do better with noticing places where my code could be structured more cleanly.
